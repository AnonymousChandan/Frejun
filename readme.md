Title: Node js Backend task


Description:
I have created Node js Backend Task by using node js express js and for database i have used mongodb. In this project, I am doing posts of  blog and updating blog body (if blog body character is starting with "a" and "A") then i am replacing last three character with *.  Using pagination which means In one page there will be 3 content only.


Installation and Run:
 First we need to install node_modules using "npm i" and after that i am using nodemon so if we will use "npm start" our application will be started.


 How to use:

 1. I am using "/post" route for post the blog which should be always have title body and category.

 2. I am using "/post" route for get all the blog.

 3. I am using "/modify/:id" for update body of blog (if body words are starting with "a" and "A" then it will be updated last three character with *).
